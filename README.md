# OPTIMUM SELECTION OF STORAGE BATTERY FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES USING MULTI CRITERIA DECISION MAKING TECHNIQUES


In this modern era the fossil fuel energy production, the environmental damage is very high. This is where the electric vehicles (EV) comes into the frame. EV’s are dominating the automotive market than the traditional internal combustion engines (IC). EV’s consist of many parts for its working but the most important part of it is the storage battery for transmission power production. So, an optimum selection of these EV batteries from a variety of battery alternative will improve the functional characteristics of an EV undertaking certain battery parameters or criteria. Now these criteria for battery selection can be given priority manually or by aid with the use of multi criteria decision making (MCDM) methods or tools. AHP, CRITIC are some MCDM tools used for criteria weightage. For the final selection of EV batteries from its variety of alternatives MCDM techniques is once again used. MCDM tools like TOPSIS, MOORA, EDAS are examples for such tools. So by the MCDM techniques we can find the best option of battery for an EV from a wide range of battery alternatives with the help of various battery criteria.
